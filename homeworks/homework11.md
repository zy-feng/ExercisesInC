### Think OS Chapter 11 reading questions

1) Why is is a bad idea to pass a `sem_t` as a parameter?

2) When you use a Semaphore as a mutex, what should its initial value be?

3) Can you think of another use for a Semaphore where you might use a different initial value?

4) In my solution to the producers-consumers problem using Semaphores,
what does it mean if the value of `queue->spaces` is `3` at some point in time?

5) What does it mean if `queue->spaces` is `-3`?

6) Why doesn't `queue_pop` have to use `queue_empty` to check whether the queue is empty?

7) Any problem that can be solved with Semaphores can also be solved with mutexes and condition variables.
How can you prove that that's true?

8) What is Property 3?  Hint: see *The Little Book of Semaphores*, 
[Section 4.3](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf).
