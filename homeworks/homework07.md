### Think OS Chapter 7 reading questions

### Caching

1) What happens if a program writes a new value into the program counter?

2) What is the fundamental problem caches are meant to solve?

3) If cache access time is 1 ns and memory access time is 10 ns, what is the average
access time of a program with hit rate 50%?  How about 90%?

4) The book gives several examples of programming language features, like loops, that tend 
to improve locality in the access pattern of instructions and/or data.  Can you think of other examples?  
Or counter-examples that might decrease locality?

5)  If you refactor a program to improve locality, would you say the program is "cache aware"?  Why not?

6) See if you can estimate the cost of a memory cache by comparing the prices of two similar CPUs with 
different cache sizes.

7) Why are cache policies generally more complex at the bottom of the memory hierarchy?

8) Can you think of a strategy operating systems could use to avoid thrashing or recover when it occurs?
